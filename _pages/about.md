Greetings! I am Mukesh Kumar Singh, originally hailing from Uttar Pradesh, a northern state of India. My academic journey has taken me from earning an undegraduate degree with physics major at [Sri Venkateswara College]:{% https://www.svc.ac.in/ %}, University of Delhi to pursuing masters' degree in physics with a specialization in gravitational wave (GW) astronomy at Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM). 

I am currently a graduate student in the Astrophysical Relativity Group at International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS-TIFR) Bengaluru, India. As part of my research activities under the guidance of Prof. Parameswaran Ajith, I straddle through GW data analysis techniques to enable the multimessenger follow-up as well as inferring the population properties of compact binary mergers. I am also a member of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration and LIGO-India Scientific Collaboration (LISC). More information about my research can be found here.	

Beyond the confines of academia, I love playing badminton rather profusely. I am always up for moutain hikes. I also love running and playing Table Tennis in my spare time. These pursuits provide me with a well-rounded perspective and serve as a source of inspiration in my academic endeavors.
